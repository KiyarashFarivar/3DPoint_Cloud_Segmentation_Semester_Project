# 3DPoint Cloud Segmentation

This repository contains the code used in my semester project to segment the lidar point cloud data.
Please refer to the readme.md file in each folder for more info.

The commented_original_pointRCNN_code folder is the original PointRCNN code that was commented by me (no guarantees the comments are correct this is just what I understood from the code). The code is not supposed to be run to use the PointRCNN code clone from the original repo <https://github.com/sshaoshuai/PointRCNN>.

The works of the student before me can be found here: <https://github.com/kangpl/semester_project_cvlab>.
