# 3DPoint Cloud Segmentation

This repository contains the code used in my semester project to segment the lidar point cloud data.
Please refer to the readme.md file in each folder for more info.

For general information about the project read the [report]<https://github.com/KiyarashFarivar/3DPoint_Cloud_Segmentation_Semester_Project/blob/master/Project_Report_and_Presentation/kiarash_farivar_semester_project_report.pdf>.

The **commented_original_pointRCNN_code** folder is the original PointRCNN code that was commented by me (no guarantees the comments are correct this is just what I understood from the code). This code is not supposed to be run to use the PointRCNN code clone from the original repo <https://github.com/sshaoshuai/PointRCNN>.

The works of the student before me can be found here: <https://github.com/kangpl/semester_project_cvlab>.

**lidar_sampling** contains  the notebooks used to generate lidar sampels according to the image opk files and the average viewpoints.

**pipe_segmentation** is the adaption of the PointRCNN code to the pipes dataset.
