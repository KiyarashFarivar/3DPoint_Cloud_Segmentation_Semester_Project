# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The finding_bboxes notebook contains the DBSCAN and PCA methods used to find the bboxes.

The pointcloud data should be downloaded. The point clouds are loaded ony by one.

The some\_scripts\_for\_viz contains some of the codes I used for visualizing boxes and points that might be helpful. Note to get an interactive 3D plot the code needs 
to be run from command line or using an editor like visual studio code; jupyter notebooks don't show 3D matplotlib plots.  

Two nice tools for just looking at .las files are <https://plas.io/> and Cloud Compare <https://www.danielgm.net/cc/>.

In From\_pointcloud\_to\_image\_coordinates you find the code to transform a point from point cloud to image pixels.
